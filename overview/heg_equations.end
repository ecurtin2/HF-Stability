\@doendnote{endnote9}{the rayleigh quotient from a physicist's perspective is $\rho _i = \mathinner {\delimiter "426830A {\protect \mathbf  {x}_i^{R}|\protect \mathbf  {A}|\protect \mathbf  {x}_i^{R}}\delimiter "526930B }$, which looks like the expectation value of $\protect \mathbf  {A}$ in the state $\protect \mathbf  {x}_i^{R}$. As $\protect \mathbf  {x}_i^{R}$ approaches the actual eigenstate of the system, the rayleigh quotient approaches the eigenvalue.}
