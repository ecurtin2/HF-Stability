abstract = {An expression for a general Slater determinant is written in the notation of second quantization. This expression has just the right number of arbitrary coefficients, so no subsidiary conditions are required, and the expression for a particular determinant is unique. This notation is used to study two problems. Firstly, a condition for a particular solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is derived. This condition is equivalent to the condition for stability of collective modes in the random phase approximation. Secondly, the determinant which minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian while giving a particular value to the expectation value of a component of angular momentum is found. In this way, an expression for the moment of inertia of an axially symmetric system is derived within the framework of the Hartree-Fock theory. The expression for a determinant is generalized to include the type of wave functions used in the theory of superconductivity.},

@article{Thouless1961,
abstract = {The properties of those states which can be obtained by exciting a single particle from the ground state of a nucleus are studied by using a perturbation-theory expansion for the Green's function. The formula obtained differs from the one used in a straightforward shall model calculation in some important respects. By comparing this formula with the condition for a solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to give a minimum of the expectation value of the energy, derived in an earlier paper, it is shown that it is always possible to choose an independent particle wave function which makes all collective modes stable in the random phase approximation. A study of the formal properties of solutions of the equation shows that the wave functions should be normalized using an indefinite metric: different eigenfunctions are then orthogonal. The eigenfunctions form a complete set, if there is no degeneracy in the solution of the Hartree-Fock equations, but not if there is a degeneracy. An upper bound for the lowest energy level is established, and the rule for calculating matrix elements of one-particle operators between the ground state and an excited state is given. It is shown to follow from the self-consistent field condition that the energy-weighted sum rules are preserved in this approximation. A discussion of spurious states is given, and it is shown that they separate out and have zero energy. A vector introduced in our earlier discussion of the cranking model is shown to be independent of all eigenvectors in this case.},

@article{Mermin1963,
abstract = {The thermal Hartree-Fock approximation of Green's function theory is shown to be equivalent, in its thermodynamic consequences, to the use of that density matrix which makes the free energy stationary over a simply restricted class of trial density matrices. The variational formulation provides a stability condition requiring one to reject those solutions of the thermal Hartree-Fock equations which do not correspond to local minima of the free energy. If only stable Hartree-Fock propagators are used, then the spectrum of density oscillations as calculated in the thermal random phase approximation can be shown to have only real frequencies. Reasons for the thermal {\{}RPA{\}} becoming unstable may therefore be found from studying the significance of unstable Hartree-Fock solutions. It is shown that isothermals with positive slope can occur in the Hartree-Fock equation of state only if an unstable solution has been used. This suggests that one type of instability is associated with a first order phase transition. This is confirmed when the approximation is applied to a lattice gas with attractive interactions. The equation of state is of the van der Waals type if the stability condition is ignored. If only solutions which give global minima to the free energy are used, the corrected isothermals are those which result from applying the Maxwell equal area construction to the naive ones. Unstable solutions correspond to the parts of the van der Waals isothermals with positive slope. The physically metastable parts correspond to solutions which are local but not global minima. A lattice gas with repulsive interactions illustrates another type of instability, characterizing a second order phase transition. In this case the naive solution becomes unstable even though no pathological behaviour appears in its equation of state, and solutions corresponding to a spatially nonuniform density of particles are required to restore stability.},

abstract = {The Overhauser problem in nuclear matter is re-examined carefully with a modern density-dependent Skyrme interaction. The energy per particle, at each density, is obtained as a function of three “order parameters” (which vanish for the spatially homogeneous plane-wave case) and which are momentum integrals over the K-dependent Overhauser orbital mixture coefficients, which in turn are determined by the three original “order parameters”. Spurious energy minima are eliminated by self-consistently solving the above non-linear problem numerically. The Overhauser Hartree-Fock state is more stable than the plane-wave state only in a density region safely below the nuclear saturation density value. This fact is interpreted as embryonic of alpha-cluster formation at sub-nuclear densities.},

The nonlocal nature of the antiferromagnetic correlations and possible noncollinearity in spin space are incorporated via an additional fundamental variable, the staggered density, which supplements the spin densities of conventional density-functional theory. Inclusion of this variable is justified by both physical and methodological considerations. We prove the corresponding Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, derive the pertinent Kohn-Sham equations, and present several approximate functionals depending explicitly on the staggered density. As a first test the formalism is applied to two simple model systems, a one-dimensional electron gas with a short-range interaction, and the three-dimensional electron gas with Coulomb interactions. These calculations serve to test the developed formalism, bur also already allow us to draw a number of conclusions regarding the stability and nature of possible spin-density wave states in homogeneous electron systems.},

abstract = {Coupled-cluster theory with connected single and double excitation operators (CCSD) and related approximations, such as linearized CCSD, quadratic configuration interaction with single and double excitation operators, coupled-cluster with connected double excitation operator (CCD), linearized CCD, approximate CCD, and second- and third-order many-body perturbation theories, are formulated and implemented for infinitely extended one-dimensional systems (polymers), on the basis of the periodic boundary conditions and distance-based screening of integrals, density matrix elements, and excitation amplitudes. The variation of correlation energies with the truncation radii of short- and long-range lattice sums and with the number of wave vector sampling points in the first Brillouin zone is examined for polyethylene, polyacetylene, and polyyne, and is shown to be a function of the degree of pi-electron conjugation or the fundamental band gaps. The t2 and t1 amplitudes in the atomic orbital (AO) basis are obtained by first computing the t amplitudes in the Bloch-orbital basis and subsequently back-transforming them into the AO basis. The plot of these AO-based t amplitudes as a function of unit cells also indicates that the t2 amplitudes of polyacetylene and polyyne exhibit appreciably slower decay than those of polyethylene, although the asymptotic decay behavior is invariably 1/r3. The AO-based t1 amplitudes appear to correlate strongly with the electronic structure, and they decay seemingly exponentially for polyethylene whereas they stay at a constant magnitude across the seventh nearest neighbors of polyacetylene and polyyne, which attests to far reaching effects of nondynamical electron correlation mediated by orbital rotation. Nonetheless, the unit cell contributions to the correlation energies taper below 10(-6) hartree after 15 A for all three polymers. The basis set dependence of the decay behavior of t2 amplitudes is also examined for linear hydrogen fluoride polymer (HF)infinity and linear beryllium polymer (Be)infinity employing the STO-3G, 6-31G, and 6-31G* basis sets, and proves to be rather small.},

abstract = {Matrix eigenvalue problems arise in a large number of disciplines$\backslash$nof sciences and engineering. They constitute the basic tool used$\backslash$nin designing buildings, bridges, and turbines, that are resistent$\backslash$nto vibrations. They allow to model queueing networks, and to analyze$\backslash$nstability of electrical networks or fluid flow. They also allow the$\backslash$nscientist to understand local physical phenonema or to study bifurcation$\backslash$npatterns in dynamical systems. In fact the writing of this book was$\backslash$nmotivated mostly by the second class of problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSeveral books dealing with numerical methods for solving eigenvalue$\backslash$nproblems involving symmetric (or Hermitian) matrices have been written$\backslash$nand there are a few software packages both public and commercial$\backslash$navailable. The book by Parlett [148] is an excellent treatise of$\backslash$nthe problem. Despite a rather strong demand by engineers and scientists$\backslash$nthere is little written on nonsymmetric problems and even less is$\backslash$navailable in terms of software. The 1965 book by Wilkinson [222]$\backslash$nstill constitutes an important reference. Certainly, science has$\backslash$nevolved since the writing of Wilkinson�s book and so has the computational$\backslash$nenvironment and the demand for solving large matrix problems. Problems$\backslash$nare becoming larger and more complicated while at the same time computers$\backslash$nare able to deliver ever higher performances. This means in particular$\backslash$nthat methods that were deemed too demanding yesterday are now in$\backslash$nthe realm of the achievable. I hope that this book will be a small$\backslash$nstep in bridging the gap between the literature on what is available$\backslash$nin the symmetric case and the nonsymmetric case. Both the Hermitian$\backslash$nand the non-Hermitian case are covered, although non-Hermitian problems$\backslash$nare given more emphasis. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis book attempts to achieve a good balance between theory and practice.$\backslash$nI should comment that the theory is especially important in the nonsymmetric$\backslash$ncase. In essence what differentiates the Hermitian from the non-Hermitian$\backslash$neigenvalue problem is that in the first case we can always manage$\backslash$nto compute an approximation whereas there are nonsymmetric problems$\backslash$nthat can be arbitrarily difficult to solve and can essentially make$\backslash$nany algorithm fail. Stated more rigorously, the eigenvalue of a Hermitian$\backslash$nmatrix is always well-conditioned whereas this is not true for nonsymmetric$\backslash$nmatrices. On the practical side, I tried to give a general view of$\backslash$nalgorithms and tools that have proved efficient. Many of the algorithms$\backslash$ndescribed correspond to actual implementations of research software$\backslash$nand have been tested on realistic problems. I have tried to convey$\backslash$nour experience from the practice in using these techniques.},

abstract = {Highly accurate results for the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) have only been achieved to date within a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) framework. Here, we introduce a newly developed stochastic technique, Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which samples the exact wavefunction expanded in plane wave Slater determinants. Despite the introduction of a basis set incompleteness error, we obtain a finite-basis energy which is significantly, and variationally lower than any previously published work for the 54-electron HEG at {\$}r{\_}s{\$} = 0.5 a.u., in a Hilbert space of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}108{\}}{\$} Slater determinants. At this value of {\$}r{\_}s{\$}, as well as of 1.0 a.u., we remove the remaining basis set incompleteness error by extrapolation, yielding results comparable or better than state-of-the-art DMC backflow energies. In doing so, we demonstrate that it is possible to yield highly accurate results with the FCIQMC method in sizable periodic systems.},

Our findings suggest that nonperturbative coupled cluster theories are acceptable for modeling electronic interactions in metals while perturbative coupled cluster theories are not.

abstract = {We discuss diagrammatic modifications to the coupled cluster doubles (CCD) equations, wherein different groups of terms out of rings, ladders, crossed-rings, and mosaics can be removed to form approximations to the coupled cluster method, of interest due to their similarity with various types of random phase approximations. The finite uniform electron gas (UEG) is benchmarked for 14- and 54-electron systems at the complete basis set limit over a wide density range and performance of different flavours of CCD is determined. These results confirm that rings generally overcorrelate and ladders generally undercorrelate; mosaics-only CCD yields a result surprisingly close to CCD. We use a recently developed numerical analysis [J. J. Shepherd and A. Gr{\"{u}}neis, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 226401 (2013)] to study the behaviours of these methods in the thermodynamic limit. We determine that the mosaics, on forming the Brueckner one-body Hamiltonian, open a gap in the effective one-particle eigenvalues at the Fermi energy. Numerical evidence is presented which shows that methods based on this renormalisation have convergent energies in the thermodynamic limit including mosaic-only CCD, which is just a renormalised MP2. All other methods including only a single channel, namely, ladder-only CCD, ring-only CCD, and crossed-ring-only CCD, appear to yield divergent energies; incorporation of mosaic terms prevents this from happening.},
